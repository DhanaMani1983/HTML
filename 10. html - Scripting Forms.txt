HTML Scripting Forms
#############################################

Scripting forms:

Javascript can be used to control form actions, example if you want to reset a form using button etc,

Handling Multiple Forms:

If there are multiple forms and if needed to identify which form has triggered postback, Add name value attr to the submit 
button type 

<input type="submit" name="" value="">

Idea is that to identify which button is clicked by name of the button

Uploading file:

To upload file use input type as file

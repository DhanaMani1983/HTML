HTML Images and Objects
#############################

Images & Objects:

Images - Pictures can be included in html document
Objects - Include interactive material like plug-in(flash/silverlight)
	  applets, videos etc.

<img src="" alt="" width=""/>

src - is the source for the image
alt - specify alternate text, if browser can't render image text will be displayed
      alt text will be used by search engine 
width - scale image by specifying width, where image will scale for both height and width
        if both height and width are specified be careful with dimensions otherwise image can become disproportinate

Use images sparingly otherwise page will take longer time to load.

Objects:

One can create objects such as flash image and include in document

<object height="" weight="" data=""></object>

you can also specify parameters for objects such as quality etc, In case if the video requires certain install you can specify
fallback text with link to installers.
